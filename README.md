# Seccurate
### Overview
In todayâ€™s world, cybersecurity must be taken into consideration while developing a new application. Failing to do so is a negligible act, which might lead to severe and unwanted results.

On one hand, there are good solutions which are quite costly and therefore usually deemed unreasonable for many SMEs; On the other hand, there are many open-source solutions which are not maintained properly, so that SMEs cannot rely on them.

Seccurate system is designed to bridge that gap and transform the SMEs nightmare into a regulated and controlled threat, making their applications more secure.
